# Web Application
This is my first web application. I'm adding a chess module from [chessboardjs.com](chessboardjs.com).

The code is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

# HTML files
My main web app is `chess01.html`. It uses the functionality in `Algorithm.js`.

The code in `tmp.html` is an example I borrowed as a starting point.

The file `MyHtml.html` uses the functions in `Hello.js`. It was my first web page, to learn the basics of javascript.

# Known bugs
* No castling
* AI is buggy, sometimes crashes/hangs on a turn
* Checkmate doesn't work
* AI doesn't move to get out of Check

If you find more please let me know.

# To-do list
* Add unit tests
* Fix all bugs!
* Incorporate database on host to store game historgy
* Better AI than just random moves
