# Web Application
This is my first web application. I'm adding a chess module from [chessboardjs.com](chessboardjs.com).

The code is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

# HTML files
My main web app is `chess01.html`. It uses the functionality in `Algorithm.js`.

The code in `tmp.html` is an example I borrowed as a starting point.

The file `MyHtml.html` uses the functions in `Hello.js`. It was my first web page, to learn the basics of javascript.

# Known bugs
* No castling
* Does not promote pawns correctly
* No AI (yet!)

If you find more please let me know.
